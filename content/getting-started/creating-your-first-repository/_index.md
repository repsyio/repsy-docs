### Creating Your First Repository

When you sign up to Repsy, a default repository is automatically created for you.  
You can start using it immediately or create new ones based on your workflow.

After logging in, you’ll be redirected to your Dashboard.

Here, you can:

- See your current plan and available storage limits
- Visualize your storage usage over time via the usage chart
- Track your total number of repositories
- View which package types (registries) you’ve created
- Check recent activity, such as repository creation or package uploads
- Quickly create a new repository using the button at the top right


### 1. Create New Repository

On the Dashboard, locate the **Create New Repository** button at the top right corner of the page.

Clicking this button will open a modal where you can define the basic settings for your new repository.

You can also create repositories later via the **Repositories** tab in the sidebar — but using the Dashboard is the fastest way to start.


### 2. Configure repository settings

After clicking **Create New Repository**, a modal will appear.

In this modal, you’ll be asked to configure:

- **Type**  
  Select the package type
- **Private**  
  By default, repositories are private.  
  You can disable this toggle to make the repository public, allowing anyone to download packages.
- **Description (optional)**  
  You may add a short description to clarify the purpose of the repository.

Once you're done, click **Create** to proceed.


### 3. View and Access Your Repository

After creating a repository, you’ll be redirected to the **Repositories** page.

Your new repository will appear in the list with its type and other details.

From here, you can:

- See your new repository in the list with its type, visibility, size, creation date, and other details
- Search, filter, or sort repositories using the controls at the top
- Use the more options menu (⋮) to open Settings or Delete the repository
- Create another repository anytime using the **Create New Repository** button in the top right
