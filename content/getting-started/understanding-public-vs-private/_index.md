### Understanding Public vs Private Repositories

Repsy repositories can be either private or public.  
Each visibility type serves different use cases depending on how you want others to access your packages.

### Private Repositories

Private is the default setting for all repositories created in Repsy.

- Requires authentication (access token) for both publishing and downloading
- Ideal for internal tools, private libraries, or CI/CD workflows
- Only authorized users or systems can access the content

### Public Repositories

Public repositories allow open access for downloading packages.

- No authentication needed to download packages
- Publishing still requires an access token
- Suitable for open-source packages or publicly shared tools

Even when a repository is public, only authenticated users can publish or modify packages.

### Switching Visibility

You can change a repository’s visibility at any time:

- Go to the Repositories tab
- Open the more options menu (⋮) next to the repository
- Click Settings
- Toggle the Private setting on or off
- Save your changes

Changes apply immediately, and you can switch back anytime.
