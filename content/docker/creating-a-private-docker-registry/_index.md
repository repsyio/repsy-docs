Before creating a registry, you need to [register to Repsy](https://docs.repsy.io/docker/register-and-create-registry/)  with a username, password, and e-mail. When you register, Repsy will create a `default` registry for you.
In the Docker section, you can create new registries and change the settings for existing ones whenever you need.
