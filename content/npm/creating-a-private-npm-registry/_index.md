Before creating a registry, you need to [register to Repsy](https://docs.repsy.io/npm/register-and-create-registry/)  with a username, password, and e-mail. When you register, Repsy will create a `default` registry for you and will publish a hello world package under it! This is how fast you can get started. 

In the npm section, you can create new registries and change the settings for existing ones whenever you need.
